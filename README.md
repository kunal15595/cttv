# Visualization of GWAS catalog.

## Color of nodes represent :
* **green** - a particular study
* **white** - a target
* **red** - a disease/trait
* **yellow** - other traits

## Allowed interactions :
* Moving the mouse to a region zooms it.
* Hover over a node to focus on a node and its associations.
* Double-click on a node to view only its associations, hide everything else. Double-click again to go back into original mode.
* Drag the node to a different region, it stays fixed to this new location, double-click to release.

## Example :
Screenshot showing exclusive mode(exclusive on trait - "alcohol drinking")
![Associations](associate.png?raw=true "Associations")

Screenshot showing focus mode(focused on a study)
![Associations](study.png?raw=true "Associations")

## TODO :
* A search capability for entire catalog.
* The database is huge, I'm just taking a random 5% of it. Try to work on a larger part.
